    "Dengue fever, also known as breakbone fever, is a viral disease caused by the dengue virus, transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti. The virus replicates in the mosquito midgut before disseminating to secondary tissues, including the salivary glands. The time it takes from ingesting the virus to actual transmission to a new host is termed the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), which takes about 8-12 days when the ambient temperature is between 25-28°C. The primary mode of transmission of the dengue virus between humans involves mosquito vectors. Prevention and control of dengue depend on vector control, as there is no specific treatment for dengue/severe dengue, and early detection and access to proper medical care greatly lower fatality rates of severe dengue.",
